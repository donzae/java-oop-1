Grades.java

Processing Grades

The file Grades.java contains a program that reads in a sequence of student grades
and computes the average grade, the number of students who pass
(a grade of at least 60) and the number who fail.
The program uses a loop (which you learn about in the next section).
Compile and run the program to see how it works.
Study the code and do the following.
Replace the statement that finds the sum of the grades with one that uses
the += operator. Replace each of three statements that increment a counting variable
with statements using the increment operator.
Run your program to make sure it works.
Now replace the “if” statement that updates the pass and fail counters with the
conditional operator.
