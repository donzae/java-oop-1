Activities at Lake LazyDays

As activity directory at Lake LazyDays Resort, it is your job to suggest appropriate
activities to guests based on the weather:

temp >= 80			: 	swimming
60   <= temp < 80	: 	tennis
40   <= temp < 60	: 	golf
temp < 40			: 	skiing

1. 	Write a program that prompts the user for a temperature,
	then prints out the activity appropriate for that temperature.
	Use a cascading if, and be sure that your conditions are no more
	complex than necessary.

2.	Modify your program so that if the temperature is greater than 95 or
	less than 20, it prints “Visit our shops!”. (Hint: Use a boolean operator
	in your condition.) For other temperatures print the activity as before.
