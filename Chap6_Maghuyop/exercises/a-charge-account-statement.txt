A Charge Account Statement

Write a program to prepare the monthly charge account statement for a customer
of CS CARD International, a credit card company.
The program should take as input the previous balance on the account
and the total amount of additional charges during the month.
The program should then compute the interest for the month, the total
new balance (the previous balance plus additional charges plus interest), and
the minimum payment due. Assume the interest is 0 if the previous balance was 0
but if the previous balance was greater than 0 the interest is 2% of the total
owed (previous balance plus additional charges).  Assume the minimum payment is
as follows:

new balance 			for a new balance less than $50
$50.00 					for a new balance between $50 and $300 (inclusive)
20% of the new balance 	for a new balance over $300

So if the new balance is $38.00 then the person must pay the whole $38.00;
if the balance is $128 then the person must pay $50;
if the balance is $350 the minimum payment is $70 (20% of 350).
The program should print the charge account statement in the format below.
Print the actual dollar amounts in each place using currency format from the
NumberFormat class.
