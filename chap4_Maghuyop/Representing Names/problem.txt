Representing Names

1.	Write a class Name that stores a person’s first, middle, and last names and provides the following methods:

		public Name(String first, String middle, String last) — constructor.
																														The name should be stored in the case given;
																														don’t convert to all upper or lower case.
		public String getFirst() — returns the first name
		public String getMiddle() — returns the middle name
		public String getLast() — returns the last name

    public String firstMiddleLast() — returns a string containing the person’s full
    																	name in order, e.g., “Mary Jane Smith”.

    public String lastFirstMiddle() — returns a string containing the person’s full name with
    																	the last name first followed by a comma, e.g., “Smith, Mary Jane”.

		public boolean equals(Name otherName) — returns true if this name is the same as otherName.
																						Comparisons should not be case sensitive.
																						(Hint: There is a String method equalsIgnoreCase that
																						is just like the String method equals except it does not
																						consider case in doing its comparison.)

		public String initials() — returns the person’s initials (a 3-character string).
															 The initials should be all in upper case, regardless of what case
															 the name was entered in. (Hint: Instead of using charAt, use the substring
															 method of String to get a string containing only the first letter—then you
															 can upcase this one-letter string. See Figure 3.1 in the text for a description
															 of the substring method.)

		public int length() — returns the total number of characters in the full name, not including spaces.

2.	Now write a program TestNames.java that prompts for and reads in two names from the user
		(you’ll need first, middle, and last for each), creates a Name object for each, and uses the methods
		of the Name class to do the following:

	a.	For each name, print first - middle - last version last - first - middle version initials length

	b.	Tell whether or not the names are the same.
